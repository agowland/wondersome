Monster of the Week an action-horror game inspired by weekly serial monster-hunting shows, like *Buffy the Vampire, Angel, Supernatural, Goosebumps* and so on. In this game, you’ll play a member of a monster hunting team and the Keeper (or the DM/GM) will create monsters and mysteries to challenge your team, bring the world to life and portray the various NPCs you’ll encounter. The game is less structured and more open-ended than D&D, but is still dice-centric and combat-heavy. As a group, we’ll decide how you guys (the hunters) work together to investigate these situations and encounters, take down the monsters, save people threatened by the abominations you confront and deal with the fallout afterwards. Your characters aren’t normal. They’re people whose lives have either been changed by, or about to be changed by, the unnatural, supernatural and the disturbing. More than that though, they’re the best of the best. Your characters are the monster hunters all other hunters look up to and want to be. For instance, if you choose the “Crooked” playbook, you aren’t just *a* crooked hunter, you’re the *definition* of a crooked hunter. Don’t worry, your playbook (the short document that guides you through your hunter class creation and play) will get you there.

The following pages are here to get you familiar with the game and help you with creating a hunter. I’ve broken it up into the essential components, but also included the PDFs of the books if you want to dive deeper. For actual sessions, you’ll need your copy of your hunter playbook, a hunter reference sheet and a pair of six-sided dice (or a digital version). A “playbook” is the guiding document for your character and your hunter archetype. They’re short and easily digestible — don’t worry! And if you decide a few sessions in (or a few years!) that you’re not jamming with your choice anymore, it’s easy to change hunter types later on, so don’t overthink it now.

### Hear Someone Else Play (if you want)

[Here’s the setup episode for The Adventure Zone’s Monster of the Week campaign, which they called Amnesty.](https://maximumfun.org/episodes/adventure-zone/setup-adventure-zone-amnesty/). It was super helpful in helping me figure out how this game works (although they hadn’t played it yet at that point, either, so listening to the whole season was both super entertaining and super informative) and they explain it way better than I ever could. I'll run through how the game works the first time we meet, like they do in this episode, but I won't do it as clearly, I'm sure. Listening to it will probably also go a long way in helping you figure out what kind of hunter you want to play, and what playbook might be best for the vibe you're going for.

>Before you read the playbooks, there are a couple of terms to at least have a general sense of. “Moves” are actions your hunter can take in various situations, similar to an ability check in D&D or other RP games. All hunters have the same basic moves, but each playbook offers extras for that hunter type. “Ratings” are the monster hunting attributes your hunter is good at. -1 is downright awful and +3 is absolutely phenomenal. More on this later/when we play!
